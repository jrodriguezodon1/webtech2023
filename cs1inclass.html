	<h2>
		About Me:
	</h2>
	<p>
		My name is Jose Rodriguez Odon and I am currently a senior. I was originally born in Venezuela and then moved to Miami for my high-school. After graduation I plan on continuing to work for myself. A few years ago I started a Social Media Influencer Marketing Agency and I have been actively running it ever since. After graduation I plan to release a software side of the company and continue working on it full time to grow it as much as I can.

	<h2>
		My Hobbies:
	</h2>
	<p>
		I’m the kind of person that enjoys trying new things and constantly getting out of my comfort zone. I don’t have any particular hobbies that I do on a consistent basis. During my free time I mostly spend my time doing action sports and learning about new cultures through traveling. On the active side, the sports that I enjoy are; rock-climbing, skydiving, skiing, and wakeboarding. And on the traveling side, I try to go places I’ve never been as often as I can.
