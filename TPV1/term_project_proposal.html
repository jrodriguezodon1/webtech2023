		What is the objective of your website?
	</h2>
	<p>

        The objective of the website that I plan on creating is a landing page that will be used for sales for a product that I am building within my company- Creator Economy Ventures, Inc.
    </p>
    <p>
        For a bit of wholistic context, as a company we are aiming to optimize and automate the influencer marketing workflow for social media creators, managers, brands, and agencies. This is in an effort to increase increase brand deal capitalization for social media creators and make it easier for businesses to run campaigns at scale. The following is an outline of the company: <a href="CEV_Brief.pdf" style="color: aqua;">CE-V Brief</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        
        For this endeavor I am building a mobile app called <a href="http://byob.ai" style="color:aqua">BYOB</a> (for social media creators and their managers), and a marketing campaign automation tool called <a href="http://creatorgenesis.com" style="color:aqua">Creator Genesis</a> (for brands and agencies).
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the above, I thought that for my term project it would be extremely valuabe to build a sales landing page for the "Creator Genesis" side of the company. The objective behind this website would be to serve as an introduction to Creator Genesis, explains what the software does and providing more context. 
        
        The full scope of the project eventually involves having two software engineers on our team building out a comprehensive platform, but for now, 
        
        This version of the website will focus on showcasing the capabilities and benefits of Creator Genesis to potential customers. It will serve as an introduction to the software, its features, and how it can help brands and agencies effectively and efficiently run influencer marketing campaigns at scale. The website will play a critical role in attracting new customers and helping us achieve our goal of becoming the standard model for creator/brand relationships.

        The website will allow users to

        Who is the target audience for your website? 
    	</h2>
	<p>
        The target audience for the Creator Genesis website are brands, marketing agencies, and media companies looking to effectively run influencer marketing campaigns at scale. Examples include large consumer goods companies, advertising agencies, and media buying firms.

    <h2>
        What content do you plan to include in each page?	</h2>
	<p>
        Home Page: An overview of Creator Genesis and its capabilities, benefits and how it helps brands and agencies with influencer marketing.
<br><br>
        Contact Us Page: A contact form for interested brands and agencies to reach out, along with company's address, phone number and email.
        <br><br>
        About Us Page: A brief history of the company, the founding team and their experience in the influencer marketing industry.
        <br><br>
        Creator Search Tool Page: This page would provide a platform for brands and agencies to search for and find the "perfect" influencer for their marketing campaigns. This page would include a search bar where users can input specific criteria such as niche, engagement, or number of followers. The results would then be displayed in a user-friendly format, showing the influencer's profile picture, name, niche, and a brief description of their content. The page would also provide filters to refine the search results based on specific criteria such as engagement rate, reach, and estimated cost per post. This page would provide an intuitive and efficient way for brands and agencies to find the right influencer for their campaign, streamlining the influencer marketing process. (The reason I have included this page is to challenge myself because I plan on learning to pull data from our creator database and learn to display it on the website!)
        <br><br>
        Start a Campaign Page: This page will be designed to guide potential customers through the process of starting a successful influencer marketing campaign using Creator Genesis. This page will provide information on the type of creators that are available for campaigns and showcase the workflow behind Creator Genesis. It will explain how the process of sourcing, outreach, onboarding, communication, activation, and tracking influencer performance works. The goal of this page is to give potential customers an overview of what to expect and how Creator Genesis can help them achieve their marketing goals efficiently and effectively.
